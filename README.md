# Churn-Prediction

## Business Question

"Which customers are likely to churn in the next period, and why?"

## Business constraints

1. False negatives are expensive (missed churn)
2. Business wants top X% high-risk customers
3. Predictions must be explainable

## ML Framing
1. Binary Classification
2. Highly imbalanced classes
3. Focus on recall + ranking quality
